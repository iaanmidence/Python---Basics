# Slicing strings:

> Since the name Santiago has 8 letters = S[0], a[1], n[2], t[3]...

name = "Santiago"
print(Santiago[1])   # answer: a.


name = "Santiago"
print(name[0:5])   # answer: Santi. (This counting excludes the last digit)


name = "Santiago"
print(name[0:8:2])   # answer: Snig. (The "2" in [0:8:2] represents it's counting 2 by 2 from index 0 to 8)


name = "Santiago"
print(name[:5])   # answer: Santi. (Starts couting from index 0 to 5)


name = "Santiago"
print(name[3:])   # answer: ago. (Starts couting from index 5 till the end)


name = "Santiago"
print(name[0::7])   # answer: So. (Starts couting from index 0, ignores the rest and jumps straight to index 7)
